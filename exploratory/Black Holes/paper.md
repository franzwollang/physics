# Horizon Duality: Black Holes and Cosmic Horizons in Noise-Gradient Theory

## 1. Introduction

This document explores a profound duality between black hole event horizons and cosmic horizons when viewed through the lens of noise-gradient theory. Particularly, we examine the remarkable symmetries that emerge when cosmic expansion is reconceived not as expanding space, but as matter continuously reducing in scale. This perspective transforms our understanding of both horizon types and suggests they may be local and global manifestations of the same underlying physical process.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Key Premises

Building upon the noise-gradient theory framework, we recapitulate several key postulates:

1. **Matter-Noise Duality**: Matter sources a noise mass-density field $\rho_N$ following an inverse distance law.

2. **Refractive Postulate**: The local index of refraction for solitonic matter waves follows $\chi(\rho_N) \simeq 1 + \alpha\rho_N$.

3. **Characteristic Length Scaling**: For a soliton wave packet, the characteristic length scales inversely with the refractive index:
   $$L_c(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{L_{c0}}{1+\alpha\rho_N(\mathbf{r})}$$

4. **Phase-Space Interaction and Energy Costs of Motion**: Phase-space is postulated to have a fundamental granularity. The motion of a soliton, particularly its acceleration relative to this structure, and its velocity through the background noise field, lead to velocity-dependent energy costs. These include internal "squeezing work" to maintain a Lorentz-contracted state (scaling with a high power of the Lorentz factor $\gamma_v$) and dissipative "promoted-noise interaction drag" from coupling with the noise field (also scaling with a high power of $\gamma_v$). These energy costs diverge as velocity approaches a limit $c_s$, thereby establishing $c_s$ as the ultimate speed limit.

## 3. Black Hole Horizons Under Noise-Gradient Theory

### 3.1 The Asymptotic Shell Model

Near what is conventionally considered a black hole's event horizon, the extreme noise gradient $\nabla \rho_N$ (as per the principles outlined in P5) dictates a strong tendency for infalling matter to reconfigure and move towards regions of higher $\rho_N$. This manifests as an immense apparent gravitational acceleration propelling matter towards the ultimate speed limit $c_s$.

For the soliton to respond to this gradient and move "deeper," it must draw upon its own internal energy reserves. This energy is required to fund several concurrent processes:

1.  **Internal Reconfiguration (Scale Downshifting)**: Adjusting its intrinsic scale $L_c$ to the higher local $\rho_N$ as per P4. This involves changes in internal energy (e.g., as amplitude varies).
2.  **Kinetic Energy of Motion**: Acquiring velocity $v$.
3.  **Relativistic Motion Costs**: As $v$ approaches $c_s$ and its Lorentz factor $\gamma_v=(1-v^2/c_s^2)^{-1/2}$ (justified in Section B.2) diverges, the energy to further increase $v$ also diverges. These costs include:
    - The escalating internal "squeezing work" to achieve and maintain the Lorentz-contracted state in its direction of motion.
    - The rapidly increasing "promoted-noise interaction drag" from the soliton's coupling with the background noise field at its contracted scale.

Consequently, while the _tendency_ to move into steeper parts of the noise gradient is immense, the soliton's _ability_ to do so by reconfiguring its own energy becomes critically limited. The diverging energy costs for approaching $v=c_s$ mean that eventually no further internal energy reconfiguration can supply the power needed to simultaneously adapt to the more extreme $\rho_N$ (and its associated intrinsic scale change) and pay the relativistic motion costs.

Matter, therefore, asymptotically approaches $c_s$ at a radius where its internal energy budget is effectively exhausted in trying to meet these combined demands. This forms an "asymptotic shell" of extreme energy density. This shell consists of matter that is both:
a) maximally scale-downshifted due to the intense local $\rho_N$ (as per P4), and
b) maximally Lorentz-contracted due to its near-luminal speed.

This shell represents a physical boundary of limiting compression and energy density, beyond which further infall is effectively impossible because the necessary energy cannot be self-funded by the soliton. It replaces the notion of a central singularity. While other acceleration-dependent dissipative mechanisms might contribute to energy loss in specific regimes, the ultimate barrier forming the horizon is the exhaustion of the soliton's ability to pay the primary diverging energy costs (internal squeezing work and promoted-noise interaction drag, as described in Premise 4) as $v \rightarrow c_s$.

Furthermore, as `\rho_N` on this shell becomes extremely intense, the solitons undergo extreme scale downshifting via P4, shrinking their characteristic length `L_c(\rho_N)` to a scale where the black hole's large-scale noise gradient `\nabla\rho_N` is perceived much more weakly. While the primary inward driving force diminishes for such a tiny soliton, it has already been accelerated to `v \approx c_s` by its prior interaction with the stronger gradient when it was larger. It now persists on this shell in a state of dynamic equilibrium:
_ Further inward motion is resisted by the already prohibitive energy costs of increasing `\gamma_v` further, even against a weakened perceived gradient, and by potential fundamental limits to P4-shrinkage.
_ Outward motion against the (now faint but still present) `\nabla\rho_N` would require re-expanding its intrinsic P4-scale—a significant reconfiguration from its highly adapted, compressed state—and overcoming the immense inertia associated with its `v \approx c_s` state.
The diverging energy costs associated with any change to its `\gamma_v \approx \gamma_{v,max}` (such as internal squeezing work and promoted-noise interaction drag) critically ensure its velocity remains capped at `c_s`. Thus, the shell is a self-stabilizing region where solitons are maximally compressed by the high ambient `\rho_N`, trapped by their own extreme kinematic state (`v \approx c_s`), and only very weakly tethered by the residual large-scale noise gradient.

This dynamic, asymptotic shell structure is further stabilized by its own effect on the background noise field. Once the shell forms and contains the substantial portion of the black hole's total effective mass `M_{BH}`, the character of the noise mass-density `\rho_N(r)` for regions _inside_ the shell (`r < r_{\text{shell}}`) changes significantly. Instead of being dominated by a `1/r` divergence towards a central point (as would be the case if mass continued to accrete to `r=0`), `\rho_N(r < r_{\text{shell}})` is now sourced by the mass distributed on the shell itself. For a spherical shell of sources, this leads to a noise-gradient `\nabla\rho_N` that is zero or very small within the interior of the shell.

The vanishing of this inward "gravitational" driving force (`a_0 \sim -c_s^2 \alpha \nabla\rho_N`) inside `r_{\text{shell}}` is a crucial consequence of the shell's formation. It means that even if a soliton were to find itself inside the shell (e.g., by having shed sufficient energy to slow down from `v \approx c_s`), there would be no strong impetus to pull it further towards a central singularity. The black hole's mass effectively resides _on_ the shell, and the interior is a region of high, relatively uniform `\rho_N` without a significant inward gradient. This self-consistently prevents the formation of a singularity and reinforces the shell as the ultimate stable boundary for infalling matter.

### 3.2 Scale Downshifting Near Horizons

As matter approaches this asymptotic shell and experiences the extremely intense local noise density `\rho_N(\mathbf{r})`, it undergoes significant scale downshifting according to P4:
$$L_c(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{L_{c0}}{1+\alpha\rho_N(\mathbf{r})}$$

Simultaneously, its amplitude increases as per P4:
$$A(\mathbf{r}) = A_0(1+\alpha\rho_N(\mathbf{r}))^{\delta}$$

where $\delta$ depends on the dimensionality of the soliton. This extreme compression and amplitude intensification are defining characteristics of matter constituting the shell.

### 3.2.1 Nature and Scaling of Proper Acceleration on the Shell

The constituents of the asymptotic shell are in a state of dynamic equilibrium, experiencing significant proper accelerations $a_{p, \text{shell}}$. These accelerations arise from a combination of factors: the need to counteract the intense inward pull of the noise gradient that formed the shell, mutual interactions between the densely packed shell solitons, and the complex dynamics of maintaining their state at $v \approx c_s$ with Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\text{shell}} \approx \gamma_{v,max}$.

To estimate the scaling of $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ with the black hole mass $M_{BH}$, we can draw an analogy with the concept of surface gravity. The noise-gradient theory postulates an apparent gravitational acceleration (Premise P5):
$$\mathbf a_0(r) \approx (c_s^2 \alpha \beta' M_{BH}/r^2)\hat{\mathbf r}$$
This $\mathbf a_0(r)$ is the coordinate acceleration experienced by a slowly moving test particle due to the noise gradient sourced by $M_{BH}$. The asymptotic shell forms at a characteristic radius $r_{\text{shell}}$. We can posit that $r_{\text{shell}}$ is determined by the point where infalling matter, drawing on its internal energy, reaches $v \approx c_s$ and can no longer fund further reconfiguration or acceleration. This radius is expected to be proportional to the effective gravitational radius of the mass $M_{BH}$ within this theory, analogous to how the Schwarzschild radius $r_s = 2GM/c^2$ scales with mass. Therefore, we assume $r_{\text{shell}} \propto M_{BH}$.

Substituting $r_{\text{shell}} \propto M_{BH}$ into the expression for $a_0(r_{\text{shell}})$:
$$ a*0(r*{\text{shell}}) \propto \frac{M*{BH}}{(M*{BH})^2} \propto \frac{1}{M*{BH}} $$
So, the characteristic strength of the noise-gradient acceleration field at the shell scales inversely with $M*{BH}$.

The proper acceleration $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ relevant for the Unruh effect is the acceleration experienced by the shell constituents in their own reference frames. While these solitons are moving at $v \approx c_s$, the accelerations keeping them on the shell (e.g., preventing further inward collapse against $a_0(r_{\text{shell}})$ or arising from mutual jostling) are plausibly proportional to this characteristic field strength $a_0(r_{\text{shell}})$. The exact relationship would involve $\gamma_{\text{shell}}$ and the specifics of shell dynamics, but if $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ scales with $a_0(r_{\text{shell}})$, then:
$$ a*{p, \text{shell}} \propto \frac{1}{M*{BH}} $$
This scaling is crucial, as it ensures that the Unruh temperature $T_U = \hbar a_{p, \text{shell}} / (2\pi c_s k_B)$ will also scale as $1/M_{BH}$, allowing it to correspond to the Hawking temperature $T_H$, a necessary condition for thermodynamic consistency of the black hole evaporation model presented next.

While a full derivation of $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ from the microphysics of soliton interactions on the shell is beyond the current scope, this scaling argument provides a basis for its relationship with $M_{BH}$.

### 3.3 Shell Dynamics, Energized Noise Bath, and Evaporation

A complete understanding of the asymptotic shell requires considering its potential for energy emission, analogous to Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation. The constituent solitons of the shell are in an extreme state: moving at $v \approx c_s$ (with Lorentz factor $\gamma_v \approx \gamma_{v,max}$), maximally P4-scale-downshifted by the intense ambient `\rho_N`, and undergoing continuous, albeit perhaps chaotic, accelerations $a_{\text{shell}}$ (with proper acceleration $a_{p, \text{shell}}$) due to mutual interactions and the dynamics of maintaining their position on the shell.

Two key processes from Premise 4 become critical here:

1.  **Energy Transfer to the Noise Bath (Promoted-Noise Drag):** Due to their high $\gamma_v$, the shell solitons constantly dissipate energy into the surrounding ambient noise field via the "promoted-noise interaction drag." This drag, scaling with a high power of $\gamma_v$ (e.g., force $\propto \gamma_v^{s+2}$), continuously transfers energy from the solitons' kinetic and internal energy pool into the local noise bath, effectively "heating" or energizing it.

2.  **Unruh Effect on the Energized Bath:** The accelerations $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ of the shell solitons cause them to perceive this energized local noise bath as a thermal Unruh bath, with an effective temperature $T_U = \hbar a_{p, \text{shell}} / (2\pi c_s k_B)$. This is not a bath formed from a pure vacuum, but from the already excited noise field.

This thermalized, energized noise bath surrounding the shell can then radiate outwards, likely as propagating disturbances, carrying energy to infinity. This emission of noise energy constitutes the analogue of Hawking radiation in this framework. The ultimate source of this radiated energy is the mass-energy of the solitons forming the shell, extracted via the promoted-noise drag mechanism and then converted into outgoing radiation through the Unruh effect acting on this energized bath.

For this picture to be consistent with established black hole thermodynamics, the characteristic temperature $T_U$ of this emitted radiation should correspond to the Hawking temperature, $T_H \propto 1/M_{BH}$. This requires that the effective proper acceleration $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ experienced by solitons on the shell be related to the black hole's effective surface gravity $\kappa$ (which also scales as $1/M_{BH}$), a plausible connection as surface gravity reflects the acceleration needed to remain near the horizon.

If this process occurs, the asymptotic shell is not perfectly static but slowly loses mass-energy over time, causing the black hole to evaporate. The rate of evaporation would depend on $T_U$ and the efficiency of the radiation mechanism from the energized bath. A detailed calculation of this evaporation rate would aim to match the power expected from Hawking radiation ($P_H \propto A T_H^4 \propto r_{\text{shell}}^2 / M_{BH}^4$). Successfully doing so could provide a means to constrain parameters of the theory, including the fractal exponent `s` of the noise spectrum and other coupling constants.

Thus, the asymptotic shell model, where promoted-noise drag energizes the local noise bath and acceleration of shell constituents thermalizes it via an Unruh-like effect, offers a more specific qualitative pathway to understanding black hole evaporation.

### 3.3.1 Connecting Shell Drag Power to Evaporation Rate

The mechanism described in Section 3.3 posits that the energy radiated by the black hole (analogous to Hawking radiation) originates from the mass-energy of the shell solitons, extracted via the promoted-noise drag they experience. This implies a direct quantitative link: in a steady-state evaporation process, the total power dissipated by drag from all solitons on the shell, $P_{\text{total drag}}$, must equal the outgoing radiation power, $P_H$.\n
We have established:

1.  $P_H \propto A T_H^4 \propto r_{\text{shell}}^2 T_H^4$. Since $r_{\text{shell}} \propto M_{BH}$ and the Unruh-derived temperature $T_U$ (which must match $T_H$) scales as $T_H \propto 1/M_{BH}$, it follows that $P_H \propto M_{BH}^2 (1/M_{BH})^4 = M_{BH}^{-2}$.
2.  The number of solitons on the shell, $N_{\text{shell}}$, is proportional to $M_{BH}$ (assuming a constant characteristic mass $m_{\text{min}}$ for these maximally scale-downshifted solitons, so $N_{\text{shell}} \approx M_{BH}/m_{\text{min}}$).
3.  Solitons on the shell are moving at $v \approx c_s$ with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\text{shell}} \approx \gamma_{v,max}$, which is assumed to be a fundamental constant determined by soliton physics (Section 3.1).
4.  The proper acceleration $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ experienced by these solitons (due to mutual interactions and maintaining their shell position) is responsible for the Unruh temperature $T_U$, and thus $a_{p, \text{shell}} \propto T_H \propto 1/M_{BH}$.

Let $F_D$ be the average drag force on a single shell soliton. The power dissipated per soliton is $P_{D, \text{soliton}} \approx F_D c_s$. The total drag power is $P_{\text{total drag}} = N_{\text{shell}} P_{D, \text{soliton}} \propto M_{BH} F_D c_s$.\n
For energy balance, $P_{\text{total drag}} = P_H$, so:
$$ M*{BH} F_D c_s \propto M*{BH}^{-2} $$\nThis implies that the average drag force $F_D$ on a shell soliton must scale as:
$$ F*D \propto M*{BH}^{-3} $$\nSince $\gamma_{\text{shell}}$ is considered constant, this $M_{BH}$ dependence in $F_D$ must arise from its relationship with $a_{p, \text{shell}}$. Given $a_{p, \text{shell}} \propto M_{BH}^{-1}$, if we assume $F_D$ is a function of $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ of the form $F_D \propto (a_{p, \text{shell}})^k$ (along with dependence on the constant $\gamma_{\text{shell}}$), then:
$$ (a*{p, \text{shell}})^k \propto (M*{BH}^{-1})^k \propto M*{BH}^{-3} $$\nThis requires $k=3$. Therefore, for the promoted-noise drag to consistently power the Hawking-like radiation across different black hole masses, the drag force $F_D$ on a shell soliton (already at $v \approx c_s$, $\gamma*{\text{shell}} \approx \gamma*{v,max}$) must be proportional to the cube of its proper acceleration: $F_D \propto (a*{p, \text{shell}})^3$.\n
This predicted $F_D \propto a_{p, \text{shell}}^3$ scaling for drag under shell conditions is a specific outcome of requiring consistency with Hawking radiation thermodynamics. It differs from the drag force scaling $F_D \propto a_s^{3/2}$ derived in other contexts (e.g., for a particle being accelerated towards $c_s$, as in the "From Noise–Gradient to a Dynamical Speed Limit" document). This suggests that the promoted-noise drag mechanism may exhibit different phenomenological scaling laws in different physical regimes, or that the simplified "e.g., force $\propto \gamma_v^{s+2}$" mentioned earlier needs to incorporate this acceleration dependence for shell solitons. Further theoretical work would be needed to derive this $a_{p, \text{shell}}^3$ dependence from first principles of soliton-noise interaction at $v \approx c_s$.\n

### 3.4 Behavior of Phase Solitons

The preceding discussion has primarily assumed solitons whose amplitude $A(\mathbf{r})$ varies with the local noise density $\rho_N(\mathbf{r})$ (amplitude solitons, generally corresponding to massive particles). We now consider the distinct behavior of "phase solitons," which, as conceptualized in the broader noise-gradient framework (cf. discussion in "From Noise–Gradient to a Dynamical Speed Limit"), are analogous to massless entities like gauge bosons. These solitons are characterized by a constant amplitude $A_0$ and topological stability, propagating at a fixed speed $c_s$.

When interacting with the black hole environment, phase solitons would experience the following:

1.  **Response to Noise Gradient (Gravitational Interaction)**: Their paths would be significantly affected by the noise gradient $\nabla \rho_N$, leading to effects analogous to gravitational lensing (path bending) as their propagation is governed by the refractive index $\chi(\rho_N)$.

2.  **Characteristic Length Scaling (P3)**: If phase solitons possess a characteristic width or length scale (e.g., $\lambda$ for a phase kink), this scale may still vary inversely with the local refractive index $\chi(\rho_N)$ (i.e., $L_c(\mathbf{r}) \propto \chi^{-1}(\rho_N)$ as per P3). This would imply a form of scale downshifting as they approach regions of intense $\rho_N$. However, the energetic consequences of this differ from amplitude solitons due to their massless nature.

3.  **Absence of Promoted-Noise Interaction Drag**: Crucially, the "promoted-noise interaction drag" – a key mechanism for energy loss and shell formation for amplitude solitons – does not apply to massless phase solitons. As outlined in the theory of the dynamical speed limit, this is because:
    - Their effective mass $m=0$ nullifies the primary coupling term in the drag's power loss equation ($P_{\text{rad}} \propto m$).
    - Their relevant phase-space volume ($\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \sim \hbar$) can remain invariant under Lorentz transformation due to their topological nature and constant speed $c_s$.
    - Their topological stability inherently constrains them to propagate at $c_s$ without the kind of dissipative interaction with phase-space cells that affects massive amplitude solitons.

**Implications for the Asymptotic Shell and Evaporation**:

Due to the absence of this dissipative drag, phase solitons would not face the same energy exhaustion budget that traps amplitude solitons in the asymptotic shell. They would approach the black hole, have their trajectories significantly altered by the intense noise gradient, but would continue to propagate at $c_s$. They might orbit within the high $\rho_N$ region or be scattered, but they would not become static, energy-depleted constituents of the shell in the same manner as amplitude solitons.

Consequently:

- Phase solitons are not expected to contribute significantly to the mass-energy density of the static components of the asymptotic shell that are formed by the accretion of matter limited by drag.
- They would not directly participate in the Hawking-like evaporation process described in Section 3.3, as that mechanism relies on the promoted-noise drag energizing the local noise bath.

While phase solitons like photons are fundamental to how we observe and interact with black holes (e.g., forming the photon sphere), their role in the _structure_ of the asymptotic shell, as defined by the noise-gradient theory for matter subject to P4-type drag, is distinct and non-participatory in terms of forming the shell itself. Their interaction is primarily one of propagation through a refractive medium dictated by $\rho_N$, rather than dissipative capture.

**Frequency Shifts, Shell Traversal, and Interior Propagation of Phase Solitons:**

Let us consider the journey of a phase soliton (e.g., a photon) from a distant region towards and into the black hole structure:

1.  **Approach, Wavelength Contraction, and Energy Density Increase**: As an infalling phase soliton approaches the black hole, it enters regions of progressively higher $\rho_N$. Its characteristic length $L_c$ (e.g., wavelength $\lambda$) contracts according to $L_c(\mathbf{r}) = L_{c0} / (1+\alpha\rho_N(\mathbf{r}))$ (from P3, P4). Consistent with the principle that the total energy of a soliton is conserved as it adapts to the local noise density $\rho_N$ (an idea underpinning the behavior of amplitude solitons as well), the total energy $E = \hbar\omega$ of the phase soliton remains constant. Consequently, its frequency $\omega$ also remains constant at its initial value, $\omega_0$. The "shrinking" of its wavelength $\lambda$ means that this constant quantum of energy is concentrated into a smaller spatial region, leading to an increase in its local energy density. The wave number $k = 2\pi/\lambda$ increases locally as $k(\mathbf{r}) = k_0 (1+\alpha\rho_N(\mathbf{r}))$, where $k_0 = \omega_0/c_s$. The propagation is characterized by a local phase velocity $v_p(\mathbf{r}) = c_s / \chi(\mathbf{r}) = \omega_0 / k(\mathbf{r})$, while its group velocity (signal velocity) remains $c_s$. The term "blueshift," if used, here refers to the decrease in wavelength, not an increase in frequency or total energy.

2.  **Shell Traversal**: The asymptotic shell is a dense region of amplitude solitons but is not an impermeable barrier to phase solitons, which are not subject to the same drag forces. An infalling phase soliton, having had its wavelength contracted by the increasing $\rho_N$ of the outer regions and the shell itself, will pass _through_ the shell. While traversing the shell, it encounters a medium of extremely high $\rho_N$ and densely packed, relativistically moving amplitude solitons. This could lead to scattering or absorption/re-emission by the shell constituents (processes not detailed here but possible additional interactions), but the shell-forming mechanism itself does not prevent its passage.

3.  **Propagation Inside the Shell**: Once inside the shell, the phase soliton enters a region where $\rho_N$ is very high but also relatively uniform, and $\nabla\rho_N \approx 0$ (as described at the end of Section 3.1).
    - In this environment, the phase soliton's wavelength remains maximally shrunken (and its energy density correspondingly maximized) due to the high, uniform $\rho_N^{\text{interior}}$. Its total energy and frequency are unchanged from their initial values.

Conversely, if a phase soliton were somehow emitted from within this interior region or from the shell itself and propagated outwards, it would experience a progressive increase in its wavelength as it moved into regions of lower $\rho_N$, its wavelength stretching and energy decreasing correspondingly.

**Magnitude of Wavelength Shifts (Photon Redshift/Blueshift):**

The factor governing these wavelength changes for a photon is $(1+\alpha\rho_N(\mathbf{r}))$. Let $\lambda_0$ be the characteristic wavelength a photon would have in a vacuum (or baseline $\rho_N \approx 0$) if its frequency $\omega_0$ (and thus energy $E_0 = \hbar\omega_0$) is set by its emission process. When this photon is present in a region with noise density $\rho_N$, its local wavelength is $\lambda_{\text{local}} = \lambda_0 / (1+\alpha\rho_N)$.

For the asymptotic shell, the term $(1+\alpha\rho_N^{\text{shell}})$ is expected to be extremely large. The reasoning is as follows: matter constituents of the shell (amplitude solitons) undergo maximal scale downshifting from their initial characteristic length $L_{c0}$ to a fundamental minimum scale, $L_{\text{min}}$ (which Section 6.5.1 suggests could be on the order of the Planck length, $\ell_P$). This means $L_{\text{min}} \approx L_{c0} / (1+\alpha\rho_N^{\text{shell}})$, so the scaling factor is approximately:
$$ (1+\alpha\rho*N^{\text{shell}}) \approx \frac{L*{c0}}{L*{\text{min}}} $$
If $L*{c0}$ is a typical hadronic scale (e.g., Compton wavelength of a proton, $\sim 1.3 \times 10^{-15}$ m) and $L_{\text{min}}$ is the Planck length ($\ell_P \sim 1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ m), this ratio $F = L_{c0}/L_{\text{min}}$ is roughly $10^{20}$.

Let's consider the implications:

1.  **Infalling Photon (Wavelength Contraction / "Blueshift")**: A photon with an initial vacuum wavelength $\lambda_0$ (e.g., from a distant source) approaches the shell. Upon reaching the shell, its local wavelength becomes $\lambda_{\text{local at shell}} = \lambda_0 / F$. Its frequency $\omega_0$ and total energy $E_0=\hbar\omega_0$ remain unchanged. For example, visible light ($\lambda_0 \approx 0.5 \times 10^{-6}$ m) would be locally compressed to a wavelength of $\approx (0.5 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}) / 10^{20} = 0.5 \times 10^{-26}$ m while at the shell.

2.  **Outgoing Photon (Wavelength Expansion / "Redshift")**: Consider a photon generated by a physical process at the shell. This emission process defines the photon's intrinsic frequency $\omega_0$ and its corresponding vacuum wavelength $\lambda_0 = 2\pi c_s / \omega_0$. At the moment and location of its emission _within the shell_, its actual local wavelength is $\lambda_{\text{emitted at shell}} = \lambda_0 / F$. As this photon propagates outwards to a distant observer (where $\rho_N \approx 0$), its wavelength expands, and the observed wavelength will be $\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_0$.
    The redshift factor, $Z$, comparing the observed wavelength to the wavelength at the point of emission, is:
    $$ Z = \frac{\lambda*{\text{observed}} - \lambda*{\text{emitted at shell}}}{\lambda*{\text{emitted at shell}}} = \frac{\lambda_0 - (\lambda_0/F)}{(\lambda_0/F)} = F - 1 $$
    Given $F \approx 10^{20}$, this is an enormous redshift factor. This means that photons emitted by processes at the shell appear to the distant observer with their natural vacuum wavelength $\lambda_0$, but this $\lambda_0$ is $F$ times larger than their incredibly short wavelength when they were actually present at the shell.
    For instance, if a process at the shell emits what would be a high-energy gamma ray in vacuum (e.g., $\lambda_0 = 10^{-12}$ m, energy $\sim 1.24$ MeV), its local wavelength *at emission* on the shell would be $\sim 10^{-12} \text{ m} / 10^{20} = 10^{-32}$ m. The distant observer would measure the $10^{-12}$ m gamma ray. The "redshift" describes how much the wavelength expanded from its super-compressed state at the source. Even such an intrinsically high-energy photon has its wavelength expanded by a factor of $F$ relative to its state at the shell.
    This framework is consistent with the idea of Hawking radiation: if the emission processes at the shell produce photons whose $\lambda_0$ values correspond to the (potentially large) wavelengths characteristic of Hawking radiation for a given $M*{BH}$, then these are what will be observed. The extreme conditions at the shell mean these photons began with local wavelengths $F$ times smaller.

This immense wavelength expansion for outgoing photons (or contraction for infalling ones) is a key prediction. The total energy $\hbar\omega_0$ of the photon is conserved throughout its journey in the static $\rho_N$ field; what changes are its local wavelength and local energy density.

**Implications of Duality for Cosmic Background Radiation (Universe-as-High-Index-Interior Model):**

Let us adopt the perspective that our observable universe ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$) is analogous to the interior of a vast black hole system. This interior, from the viewpoint of a hypothetical "External True Vacuum" ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$, where refractive index $\chi_{\text{true-vac}} \approx 1$), is characterized by a globally high, uniform background noise density $\rho_N^{\text{univ-bg}}$. This gives our universe an effective refractive index $\chi_{\text{bg}} = (1+\alpha\rho_N^{\text{univ-bg}}) \gg 1$ _relative to $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$_. However, for observers and all physical processes _within_ $\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$, this high $\rho_N^{\text{univ-bg}}$ constitutes the local reference vacuum; our rulers, clocks, and locally measured speed of light $c_s^{\text{local}}$ are scaled and defined by this medium, resulting in a locally perceived refractive index $\chi_{\text{local perception}} \approx 1$.

The "Shell" or Cosmic Horizon is the interface where the refractive index transitions from $\chi_{\text{true-vac}} \approx 1$ to $\chi_{\text{bg}} \gg 1$.

1.  **CMB Redshift (Internal Origin)**: The observed CMB redshift ($1+Z_{CMB} \approx 1100$) reflects the change in characteristic scale $L_c$ of structured matter within $\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$ between $t_{\text{CMB}}$ and $t_{\text{now}}$. These scales and wavelengths are measured using our local, co-moving, and co-scaled rulers, all within our effective $\chi_{\text{local perception}} \approx 1$ environment. The intrinsic energy $\hbar\omega_0$ of CMB photons is conserved.

2.  **Radiation from the Universe's "Boundary" into Our Interior**: Let the ultimate "Boundary" of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$ be a region of even higher refractive index $\chi_{\text{boundary}}$ (relative to $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$), where $\chi_{\text{boundary}} > \chi_{\text{bg}}$. If photons are emitted at this Boundary with energy $E_0$ and what would be wavelength $\lambda_0$ in $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$, their physical wavelength upon entering our $\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$ (index $\chi_{\text{bg}}$ relative to true vac) is $\lambda_{\text{phys}} = \lambda_0 / \chi_{\text{bg}}$. When we measure this with our local rulers (which are scaled by $1/\chi_{\text{bg}}$ relative to true-vac rulers), we obtain a measured wavelength numerically equal to $\lambda_0$. The photon has energy $E_0$. No energy-wavelength mismatch is perceived by us for individual photons.

3.  **Radiation from "Extracosmic Space" ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$) Entering Our Universe ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$)**: Consider a photon from $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$ (energy $E_0$, wavelength $\lambda_{\text{true-vac}}$). Upon entering $\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$ (index $\chi_{\text{bg}}$ relative to true vac):
    - Its energy $E_0$ and frequency $\omega_0$ are conserved.
    - Its physical wavelength becomes $\lambda_{\text{phys in univ}} = \lambda_{\text{true-vac}} / \chi_{\text{bg}}$.
    - When we measure this wavelength with our local rulers (scaled by $1/\chi_{\text{bg}}$ relative to true-vac rulers), the numerical value we obtain is $\lambda_{\text{measured by us}} = \lambda_{\text{true-vac}}$.
    - The photon's energy $E_0$ and our locally measured wavelength $\lambda_{\text{measured by us}}$ are self-consistent via $E_0 = (2\pi \hbar c_s^{\text{local}}) / \lambda_{\text{measured by us}}$, where $c_s^{\text{local}}$ is our locally measured speed of light. Thus, for any individual transiting photon, no energy-wavelength anomaly is perceived _locally by us_.

**Observational Challenge: Amplified Energy Density / Temperature of Extracosmic Radiation Fields:**

The primary observational puzzle, if $\chi_{\text{bg}} \gg 1$ (our universe's index relative to true vacuum), arises from the transformation of _energy density_ for any radiation _field_ entering from $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$.
While individual photon energies $E_0$ are conserved and their locally measured wavelengths $\lambda_{\text{measured by us}}$ appear normal, the physical compression of the field into a smaller coordinate volume (as seen from $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$ by the factor $1/\chi_{\text{bg}}$ in each linear dimension) means the energy density is greatly amplified.
For a thermal blackbody radiation field from $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$ at temperature $T_{\text{ext}}$, upon entering $\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$, its effective temperature as perceived by us (or as it would drive thermodynamic processes in our universe) would be $T_{\text{obs}} \approx \chi_{\text{bg}} T_{\text{ext}}$. This arises because the total energy density scales as $U \propto T^4$, and the energy density is amplified by a factor related to $\chi_{\text{bg}}^4$ when transforming the blackbody spectrum from $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$ into $\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$ (due to frequency scaling of modes and energy per mode for a given distribution).
If, for example, $\chi_{\text{bg}} \sim F \approx 10^{20}$ (implying our universe's background state _is_ the maximally compressed "shell state" relative to a true vacuum), then even a very cold $T_{\text{ext}} \sim 2.7$K extracosmic background would manifest in our universe as an astonishingly hot background with $T_{\text{obs}} \sim 10^{20} \times 2.7$K. The absence of such an ultra-hot background poses a severe constraint.

Possible resolutions include:
a) $\chi_{\text{bg}} \approx 1$: Our universe's background is not, in fact, a high-index medium relative to a true vacuum. The factor $F$ would then relate only to the compression of structured matter to $L_{\text{min}}$ within this near-true-vacuum.
b) Effective Cosmic Isolation: Our universe has negligible energetic exchange with any $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$.
c) The transition physics at the "Shell" is more complex, perhaps involving non-conservation of photon number or rapid thermalization that prevents the simple $T_{\text{obs}} \approx \chi_{\text{bg}} T_{\text{ext}}$ scaling for an entire field.
d) **CMB as Redshifted Relic of Maximally Amplified Extracosmic Radiation**: An alternative interpretation posits that our universe's background refractive index relative to a true vacuum, $\chi_{\text{bg}}$, is itself the maximum possible compression factor derived from black hole shell considerations, i.e., $\chi_{\text{bg}} \approx F \approx 10^{20}$. This implies our universe's fundamental background state _is_ analogous to the "shell state" of ultimate compression relative to $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$.
i. _Initial Amplified Temperature_: Extracosmic radiation from $\mathcal{M}_{\text{true-vac}}$ (at a generic temperature $T_{\text{ext}}$) enters our $\mathcal{M}_{\text{univ}}$. Due to $\chi_{\text{bg}} \approx F$, this field manifests _within_ our universe with an initial, extremely high effective temperature $T_{\text{amplified}} \approx F \cdot T_{\text{ext}}$. For instance, if $T_{\text{ext}} \sim 2.7$K (a hypothetical temperature of the meta-vacuum), then $T_{\text{amplified}} \sim 10^{20} \times 2.7$K. This represents the primordial hot radiation state in our universe.
ii. _Matter Scale Reduction and Total Redshift_: From this initial $T_{\text{amplified}}$ state, matter within our universe (including our reference scales which define our measurements) has undergone continuous scale reduction $L_c(t) = L_{c0} e^{-H_0 t}$ until the present day. The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) we observe at $T_{\text{CMB}} \approx 2.7$K is this $T_{\text{amplified}}$ field, subsequently redshifted by a total factor $1+Z_{\text{total}}$ due to this entire history of matter scale reduction.
iii. _Magnitude of Total Redshift_: The required total redshift to cool the $T_{\text{amplified}}$ field to the observed $T_{\text{CMB}}$ is $(1+Z_{\text{total}}) = T_{\text{amplified}} / T_{\text{CMB}} \approx (F \cdot T_{\text{ext}}) / T_{\text{CMB}}$. If we assume $T_{\text{ext}} \approx T_{\text{CMB}}$ (e.g., if the meta-vacuum also possesses a $\sim 2.7$K background), then this implies a total redshift factor $1+Z_{\text{total}} \approx F \approx 10^{20}$.
iv. _Consistency with Matter Evolution_: This vast redshift factor means that the characteristic scales of matter $L_c(t_{\text{initial}})$ when the $T_{\text{amplified}}$ field was established were $F$ times larger than current matter scales $L_c(t_{\text{now}})$. If $\chi_{\text{bg}} \approx F$, then current structured matter (e.g., protons, with true-vacuum scale $L_{c0}^{\text{proton,true-vac}}$) is already at its minimum possible scale within our universe: $L_c^{\text{proton,now}} = L_{c0}^{\text{proton,true-vac}} / F \approx L_{\text{min}}$. Thus, $L_c(t_{\text{initial}}) \approx F \cdot L_{\text{min}}$, which is consistent with the scale of uncompressed matter in a true vacuum ($L_{c0}^{\text{proton,true-vac}}$) before it effectively became part of our $F$-compressed universe.
v. _Implications_: In this scenario, the CMB is a direct probe of the _total_ scale reduction matter has undergone since our universe effectively "crystallized" with its maximal $\chi_{\text{bg}}$ from an external influx. The conventionally cited "surface of last scattering" at $\sim 3000$K would then represent a much later, intermediate epoch in this far grander redshift history ($Z_{SLS} \approx 1100$ out of $Z_{\text{total}} \approx 10^{20}$). This model provides an origin for the initial ultra-hot state, linking it directly to the maximum blueshift factor $F$ acting on an external radiation source, followed by an equally extensive redshifting due to matter scale reduction.

This revised perspective emphasizes that while individual photon properties might seem locally self-consistent, the implications for entire radiation fields entering a high-index universe are profound.

### 3.5 Asymmetric Shells in External Gradients: The Binary Black Hole Case

The preceding discussion has considered an isolated black hole. However, in realistic astrophysical settings, black holes often exist in environments with external noise gradients, $\nabla\rho_N^{\text{ext}}$, for instance, from nearby massive objects. A binary black hole system provides a powerful and simplified case for analyzing the expected effects.

Consider a binary system of two black holes, $M_A$ and $M_B$. The asymptotic shell of black hole $M_A$ is not only subject to its own noise field $\rho_{N,A}$ but also resides in the gradient $\nabla\rho_{N,B}$ created by its companion. The total noise density influencing shell formation is $\rho_N(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_{N,A}(\mathbf{r}) + \rho_{N,B}(\mathbf{r})$. This has several profound consequences for the shell's structure and dynamics:

1.  **Shell Distortion**: The total noise density will be higher on the side of $M_A$ facing $M_B$. According to the characteristic length scaling (P4, $L_c \propto (1+\alpha\rho_N)^{-1}$), the scale downshifting of infalling matter is more severe on this side. This implies the shell's equilibrium state will be distorted from a perfect sphere. Plausibly, the shell would be compressed on the side facing its companion, leading to an ovoid shape, with the shell's effective center potentially displaced from the black hole's barycenter.

2.  **Anisotropic Shell Accelerations**: The external gradient $\nabla\rho_{N,B}$ imposes an additional, non-radial acceleration field across the shell of $M_A$. This breaks the spherical symmetry of the net forces, causing the proper accelerations $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ experienced by shell solitons to become anisotropic. The magnitude and direction of $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ would now depend on the soliton's position ($\theta, \phi$) on the shell relative to the companion black hole.

3.  **Anisotropic Hawking Radiation and Recoil Force**: Since the Unruh temperature $T_U = \hbar a_{p, \text{shell}} / (2\pi c_s k_B)$ is directly proportional to the proper acceleration, an anisotropic $a_{p, \text{shell}}$ leads to an anisotropic surface temperature for the shell. The black hole would radiate more intensely in some directions than others (e.g., perhaps becoming "hotter" on the side facing its companion). This anisotropic emission of radiation carries momentum, resulting in a net recoil force on the black hole—a "rocket effect" directed along the axis connecting the two masses.

**Observational Consequences for Binary Systems:**

- **Modified Orbital Dynamics**: This recoil force is non-gravitational in the standard sense and would act in addition to the orbital dynamics governed by the mutual noise gradients. It would cause the orbit to deviate from a pure two-body gravitational inspiral, potentially accelerating or decelerating the orbital decay.
- **Gravitational Wave Signatures**: The distortion of the shells and the presence of these anomalous recoil forces could imprint subtle modifications on the gravitational wave signal produced during the inspiral and merger. The masses and spins inferred from the waveform might show discrepancies from general relativistic predictions if these effects are significant.
- **Pulsar Timing**: For a pulsar orbiting a binary black hole system, the anomalous acceleration of the system's barycenter due to mutual recoil forces could be detectable as a long-term deviation in the pulsar's timing model.

Analyzing binary black hole systems through this lens thus offers a rich avenue for testing the predictions of the asymptotic shell model beyond the isolated, spherically symmetric case.

## 4. Reconceiving Cosmic Expansion as Matter Scale Reduction

### 4.1 The Scale Reduction Hypothesis

Instead of space expanding, we propose that matter undergoes continuous scale reduction according to:
$$L_c(t) = L_{c0} e^{-H_0 t}$$

where $H_0$ is the rate of scale reduction, corresponding to what is conventionally interpreted as the Hubble constant. Under this framework, the apparent expansion of distances between objects emerges as their intrinsic sizes shrink while the coordinate distances remain fixed.

### 4.2 Cosmic Scale Dynamics

This cosmic scale reduction manifests as:

1. **Amplitude Evolution**: As matter scales down, its amplitude increases according to:
   $$A(t) = A_0 e^{\delta H_0 t}$$

2. **Global Noise Field Evolution**: The cosmic scale reduction can be understood as a global, uniform increase in the background noise field density:
   $$\rho_N^{\text{global}}(t) = \rho_N^0 e^{H_0 t}$$

3. **Apparent Recession**: Objects appear to recede from each other because their characteristic scales are continuously decreasing while coordinate distances remain fixed.

## 5. Duality Between Horizons

### 5.1 Unified Scale Dynamics

Both horizon types now involve the same fundamental process - scale reduction of matter:

- **Black Hole Horizons**: Localized scale reduction due to extreme noise gradients
- **Cosmic Horizons**: Global, uniform scale reduction due to temporal evolution of the background noise field

The mathematical descriptions become:

- Black hole: $L_c(\mathbf{r}) = L_{c0}/(1+\alpha\rho_N(\mathbf{r}))$
- Cosmic: $L_c(t) = L_{c0} e^{-H_0 t}$

### 5.2 Information Boundaries

Both horizons represent boundaries where information transfer becomes impossible:

- At black hole horizons, the extreme acceleration exceeding $K_{\text{drag}}$ forces $v \approx 0$, preventing outward signal propagation
- At cosmic horizons, the relative scale reduction has proceeded beyond the point where causal contact can be maintained

### 5.3 Observer-Independent Physical Processes

Under this framework, both phenomena become observer-independent physical processes:

- The black hole frozen shell forms at a specific radius where acceleration exceeds $K_{\text{drag}}$
- The cosmic horizon represents a physical boundary where matter has shrunk below a threshold scale relative to its initial state

## 6. Theoretical Implications

### 6.1 Unified Origin of Horizons

Both horizon types emerge from the same underlying mechanism - matter adapting its scale in response to noise field properties:

- Black holes represent a response to localized, intense noise gradients
- Cosmic horizons represent a response to the global evolution of the background noise field

### 6.2 Time Direction and Scale Evolution

This framework suggests a profound connection between the arrow of time and the direction of scale reduction. The forward direction of time corresponds to:

- Decreasing characteristic length scales
- Increasing amplitude of matter waves
- Increasing noise field density

### 6.3 Alternative to Dark Energy

What conventionally appears as dark energy driving cosmic acceleration would actually be an accelerating rate of matter scale reduction:
$$\frac{d^2L_c}{dt^2} < 0$$

This could arise from a nonlinear feedback between the global noise field density and soliton scale dynamics, eliminating the need for an exotic dark energy component.

### 6.4 Resolution of the Information Paradox

The frozen shell model of black holes suggests that information isn't lost to a singularity but stored in a highly compressed state within the frozen shell. Similarly, information beyond the cosmic horizon isn't truly lost but beyond reach due to matter within the cosmic horizon having scaled down beyond a certain threshold.

## 6.5 Origin of Black Hole Area Scaling Laws

Area Law Emergence in the Frozen Shell Model

One of the most profound features of black hole physics is that quantities like entropy and information content scale with surface area rather than volume, contrary to ordinary physical systems. The frozen shell model provides a natural explanation for this otherwise puzzling characteristic:
6.5.1 Matter Distribution in the Frozen Shell
In the noise-gradient theory, matter approaching a black hole doesn't collapse to a central singularity but instead decelerates to form a frozen shell at the radius where the local acceleration exceeds $K_{\text{drag}}$. The structure of this shell is fundamentally two-dimensional:
Radial Compression: As matter approaches the shell, it experiences extreme scale downshifting:
$$L_c(r) = \frac{L_{c0}}{1+\alpha\rho_N(r)} \to \text{minimum scale as } r \to r_{\text{shell}}$$
Dimensional Reduction: The extreme radial compression effectively eliminates one degree of freedom, transforming the 3D matter distribution into a quasi-2D structure.
Shell Thickness: The thickness of this shell approaches a fundamental minimum length scale determined by the noise field properties, likely on the order of Planck length.
6.5.2 Information Encoding at the Shell
The information content of all matter that formed the black hole becomes encoded on this shell rather than within a volumetric region:
Surface Density Scaling: The maximum information density scales with the shell's surface area:
$$I_{\text{max}} \propto A_{\text{shell}} = 4\pi r_{\text{shell}}^2$$
Holographic Encoding: Each Planck-scale "cell" on the shell surface can encode a finite amount of information about the matter that formed it, directly yielding the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:
$$S = \frac{k_B A}{4 \ell_P^2}$$
where $\ell_P$ is the Planck length.
6.5.3 Physical Mechanism for Area Laws
The area scaling emerges naturally from the noise-gradient mechanism:
Noise Field Boundary Conditions: The sharp transition at the shell where $a = K_{\text{drag}}$ creates boundary conditions for the noise field that can only support surface modes.
Phase Space Constraints: The extreme compression of phase space cells at the shell boundary restricts information encoding to surface degrees of freedom.
Topological Protection: Information becomes topologically encoded in the 2D surface pattern of the noise field at the shell, similar to how topological phase solitons preserve information.
This surface encoding explains why black hole thermodynamics, quantum information theorems, and gravitational physics consistently point to area-scaling laws. Rather than being a mysterious property requiring extra dimensions or holographic principles as fundamental postulates, area scaling emerges naturally from the dynamics of matter encountering the extreme noise gradients at the black hole boundary.
The frozen shell model thus provides a concrete physical mechanism for the holographic principle, suggesting it's not merely a mathematical property but a direct consequence of how matter behaves when it reaches the fundamental threshold where $a = K_{\text{drag}}$.

## 7. Observational Consequences

### 7.1 Black Hole Signatures

This model predicts:

1. Absence of true singularities
2. Distinctive gravitational wave signatures from the frozen shell structure
3. Modified Hawking radiation profile reflecting the layered structure rather than a point source

### 7.2 Cosmological Tests

The scale reduction framework predicts:

1. Subtle changes in fundamental constants over cosmological time as the universal scale reduction affects interaction strengths
2. Fine structure in the cosmic microwave background reflecting early phase transitions in scale dynamics
3. Modified redshift interpretation where the observed redshift results from both the change in scale and the resulting change in interaction energies

### 7.3 Laboratory Tests

While the global scale reduction occurs too slowly for direct laboratory measurement, precision metrology comparing different physical systems might detect signatures of differential scale reduction based on coupling to the noise field.

## 8. Mathematical Appendix: Scale Transformation and Apparent Expansion

To demonstrate how scale reduction creates apparent expansion, consider two objects separated by coordinate distance $D$. Their physical size is given by $L(t) = L_0e^{-H_0t}$. The apparent distance measured in terms of their own scale is:

$$D_{\text{apparent}}(t) = \frac{D}{L(t)} = \frac{D}{L_0e^{-H_0t}} = \frac{D}{L_0}e^{H_0t}$$

This exponential growth in apparent distance is identical to the standard cosmological scale factor $a(t) = e^{H_0t}$ for a de Sitter universe, demonstrating the formal equivalence between expansion of space and reduction of matter scale.

## 9. Conclusion

The reconceptualization of cosmic expansion as matter scale reduction reveals a profound duality between black hole horizons and cosmic horizons. Both emerge as manifestations of the same underlying process - the adaptation of matter's characteristic scale to local and global properties of the noise field. This framework offers a unified perspective on horizon physics, potentially resolving longstanding puzzles in both black hole physics and cosmology while suggesting new empirical tests to distinguish between conventional models and this scale-reduction alternative.

By viewing horizons through the lens of noise-gradient theory, we obtain not merely an analogical relationship but a deep physical connection suggesting that black holes and cosmic expansion may be complementary manifestations of the same fundamental physics operating at different scales and intensities.

### B.1 Fundamental Distinction: Environmental vs. Acceleration-Induced Noise

This framework makes a crucial distinction between two types of noise effects:

1. **Environmental Noise Gradients**:

   - Pre-existing spatial variations in the noise field ($\nabla\rho_N$)
   - Create refractive index variations: $\chi(\rho_N) \simeq 1 + \alpha\rho_N$
   - Produce gravity-like effects: $\mathbf{a}_0 \approx (c_s^2 \alpha \beta' M/r^2)\hat{\mathbf{r}}$
   - Solitons passively respond by scale downshifting: $L_c(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{L_{c0}}{1+\alpha\rho_N(\mathbf{r})}$
   - Independent of the soliton's presence or motion

2. **Acceleration-Induced Noise Effects**:
   - Generated by the soliton's non-inertial motion relative to phase-space cells
   - Not present in the environment prior to acceleration
   - Specific to each soliton's properties and motion
   - Analogous to how accelerating charges create their own radiation fields

This distinction explains why the radiative drag effect depends on the specific properties of each soliton and its acceleration, rather than being a universal environmental effect like gravity.

### B.2 Justification and Use of the Lorentz Factor for Comoving Frame Analysis

Before analyzing the soliton's experience in its comoving frame, we must establish the appropriate relativistic kinematics. The constant `c_s` in this framework is not merely a wave propagation speed but is identified with the fundamental speed limit of causal influence (akin to `c` in standard physics, as suggested by its role in the emergent gravitational interaction, Eq. P5).

A soliton moving at velocity `v` relative to the background noise field experiences an interaction that is inherently velocity-dependent. A leading-order analysis of such interactions (similar to that yielding a preliminary contraction factor in studies of NLSE solitons in noise, e.g., `L_char(v) \approx L_0 / \sqrt{1 + \beta(v/c_s)^2}`) might suggest a Euclidean-like geometric factor. However, such a factor does not ensure that `L_char(v) \rightarrow 0` as `v \rightarrow c_s`, a condition essential for consistency with `c_s` as an ultimate speed limit where physical lengths are expected to vanish in the direction of motion.

For the soliton's dynamics and its structural response to motion to be consistent with the principle of causality at speed `c_s`, its kinematics must align with the structure of Minkowski spacetime, where `c_s` is an invariant speed. The standard Lorentz factor is the unique descriptor of transformations in such a spacetime.

Therefore, to ensure consistency with causality at the speed `c_s`, we adopt the standard Lorentz factor for describing transformations to the comoving frame and the resulting kinematic effects. The proper acceleration experienced by a soliton moving at speed `v` relative to an acceleration field $\mathbf a_0$ (defined by the noise gradient) in its comoving frame is then given by:

$$a_{\rm eff}=\gamma_v^{3}\,(\mathbf a_0\!\cdot\!\hat v)$$

where $\gamma_v=(1-v^{2}/c_s^{2})^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor. Let $a_s = |\mathbf a_0 \cdot \hat v|$ be the magnitude of the acceleration component along the velocity.

This proper acceleration determines how the soliton experiences the phase-space cell structure in its own reference frame. The $\gamma_v^3$ factor arises from the standard relativistic transformation of acceleration and plays a crucial role in the drag mechanism at high velocities.

where $\mu_f \approx 1$. Fermat's principle in the refractive medium therefore yields an apparent gravitational acceleration $\mathbf a_0 = -c_s^2 \alpha \nabla \rho_N^{(0)}$, which represents the soliton's tendency to reconfigure its path and internal state in response to the noise gradient, drawing the necessary energy for such reconfiguration and any resultant motion from its internal energy budget or its interaction energy with the noise field, rather than from conventional work by an external field. For a dominant point source $M$ where $\rho_N^{(0)} \approx \beta' M/r$ (locally), this gives:

$$\boxed{\,\mathbf a_0 \approx (c_s^2 \alpha \beta' M/r^2)\hat{\mathbf r} \text{ for a dominant point source } M \,}\tag{P5}$$

This matches Newtonian gravity if $c_s^2 \alpha \beta' = G$. $c_s$ is the soliton group speed at the reference mean-field noise level.

### B.10 Mathematical Verification

This detailed analysis confirms that while Lorentz contraction would suggest an enhancement factor of $\gamma_v^2$ in the energy spacing, time dilation and nonlinear effects partially compensate, resulting in the smaller enhancement factor of $\gamma_v^{3/2}$ used in the main text and Appendix A.
