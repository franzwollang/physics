# Dark Sector (Scale‑Downshifting) — One‑Page Claims Sheet (internal)

## Core claims (what is established)

- Unified mechanism: spatial, inhomogeneous scale‑downshifting (gravity/halos) + temporal, homogeneous sliding‑window drift (dark energy) from the same fractal vacuum background.
- Dark matter branch: isothermal halos emerge (approximately `ρ(r) ∝ 1/r^2`) with flat rotation curves; prediction `v_flat^2 ≈ 2 σ^2` linking rotation speed to halo velocity dispersion.
- Dark energy branch: for near scale‑free `S(k) ∝ 1/k` and slowly moving IR/UV window edges, `w_eff + 1 ≈ −1.3×10^{−3}` today; more generally `w+1 ≈ [α − β(1+q)]/[3 ln(k_max/k_min)]`.
- Early‑universe consistency: negligible effective DE at recombination; backreaction term `|Q_D|/H^2 ≲ 10^{-3}` too small to mimic DE.

## Assumptions and scope

- Postulates P1–P6 (local units from solitons; noise field `ρ_N`; monotone scale–environment coupling; fractal/stationary spectrum; sliding window; conformal covariance of observables).
- Mapping: local noise proxy `τ^2 ∝ ρ_N`; use `c_s` for the universal signal speed.

## Key relations

- Spatial branch (gravity): screened near sources; superposition outside finite regions ≈ `1/r` potential; isothermal equilibrium → `ρ(r) ∝ 1/r^2`, flat `v_c(r)`.
- Temporal branch (window): `ρ_{N,eff}(t) = ∫_{k_min(t)}^{k_max(t)} S(k)
dk`, `dρ_{N,eff}/dt = S(k_max) ḱ_max − S(k_min) ḱ_min`.
- Prediction linkage: `w+1 ≈ [α − β(1+q)]/[3 ln(k_max/k_min)]` with natural `α=β=1`.

## Where established (paper refs)

- Postulates and notation: §1.
- Dark matter branch: §2.1 (isothermal halos, flat curves; `v_flat^2 ≈ 2 σ^2`).
- Dark energy branch: §2.2 and Appendix C (sliding window; `w_eff`).
- Consistency with history and bounds: §3 (EDE fraction; growth; varying constants).

## Deferred/explicitly not done here

- Full data pipeline for galaxy rotation/lensing fits and cosmological w(z) constraints; placeholders provided for relations.
- Joint calibration of `α, β` window‑edge prescriptions across datasets; robustness bands to be quantified.

## Validation/diagnostics (minimal targets)

- Galaxies: test `v_flat^2 ≈ 2 σ^2` across morphologies; compare to lensing masses.
- Cosmology: compute `w_eff(z)` from sliding window against SNe/BAO/CMB constraints; confirm tiny `|w+1|` today.
- Weak‑field mapping consistency: recover `Φ ∝ 1/r` outside finite sources in local units.
