# Relativity from Soliton–Noise — One‑Page Claims Sheet (internal)

## Core claims (what is established)

- Minimal postulates (P1–P8) suffice to recover GR phenomenology in the appropriate regimes.
- Universal phase sector with locally constant `c_s`: `S_φ = (κ w_*^2/2) ∫ η^{μν} ∂_μ φ ∂_ν φ d^4x`; composition‑independent coupling ⇒ single causal cone and metric universality.
- Newtonian and PPN: in weak, static fields, recover `∇^2 Φ = 4πG ρ_m` with PPN `γ = β = 1` at leading order.
- Geometric optics: refractive‑index view `n(x)=c_0/c_s(x)` yields null geodesics of an effective metric; weak equivalence principle follows from universality.

## Assumptions and scope

- Local units from grains (rulers/clocks from localized solitons). Environmental co‑variation keeps `c_s` approximately invariant in local units.
- Graph microfoundation is delegated to the companion graph paper; this paper is continuum‑first.

## Key relations

- `c_s^2 = κ w_*^2`, with `w_* = √(β_pot/(2γ))`, `γ = (η_0/2) V_K` (from graph mapping).
- Weak‑field metric: `g_00 = −(1+2Φ)`, `g_ij = (1−2Φ) δ_ij`.
- Conservation + covariance + Newtonian limit ⇒ Einstein equations with `Λ_eff` (by standard uniqueness theorems).

## Where established (paper refs)

- P1–P8: §Minimal Postulates.
- Constant‑cone/`c_s`: Phase Sector → Local Lorentz symmetry.
- Geometric optics/equivalence: Geometric Optics → Effective Metric.
- Newtonian/PPN: Newtonian Limit and PPN.
- Einstein equations: Covariance + Conservation → Field Equations.

## Deferred/explicitly not done here

- Full curvature‑sector derivation from the phase operator (wave/Laplace–Beltrami) to an action for the emergent metric.
- Cosmological fits beyond outline; mapping of `Λ_eff` via sliding‑window is referenced, detailed pipeline deferred.

## Validation/diagnostics (minimal targets)

- Two‑way signal speed equals `c_s` in local units; isotropy tests.
- Light deflection/time delay consistent with `γ=β=1` at leading order.
- Consistency checks: independence of `c_s` from grain volume `V_K` once `(κ, β_pot, γ)` are fixed.
